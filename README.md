#### React Redux Rap Battle

##### Description
(A summary of what you envision the project becoming. This does not have to be detailed or even a set in stone, but rather a snapshot of your current goals)

React-Redux Rap Battle is a Javascript React Redux game that puts two rappers against each other. This will be an RPG-style game where different characters will have different strengths and weakness’. Depending on which characters are selected, the last rapper standing will be the one with the superior stats such as a higher attack or higher defense.

##### Use Case
(Who are the main users? What problems are they facing that you will solve? What will it do for users? What is the purpose/goal of the project?)

The main users will be people interested in music and gaming. This is merely an app that serves as entertainment for people interested in both categories. This could come in handy down in the road in the world of advertising, as a lot of brands are gamifying things.

I can see this type of app being a promotional campaign for a brand. For instance, Louis Vuitton created this video game: https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/stories/endless-runner-game

##### Minimum Viable Product
(List the absolute minimum features the project requires before it is considered in a pre-alpha state)
 *react drop down feature to select a character on one side, and another to select the opponent
 *Show visual of rapper that is selected. 
 *click function that will start an attack against an opponent on button click
 *new component that shows who the victor is when one opponent’s HP goes to zero

##### Tools for MVP
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)

 *Visual Studio Code
 *React
 *Redux	
 *Bootstrap of other CSS framework (may use Less framework)
 *Firebase to create a user sign-in and store database info of characters


##### Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
 *Display different lyrics for visual appeal when a character attacks
 *Rather than let users decide which famous rappers go against each other, create a randomizer that selects who faces off
 *UI to show HP levels, as well as HP going down as one opponent is attacked.

##### Tools for Additional Features
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your additional features. Be specific.)
 *JavaScript
 *React
 *Redux
 *Perhaps an API that pulls rap lyrics 

##### Additional Information
(Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?)

I will attempt to do this with React and Redux, but may stick to JavaScript if I’m having issues.
I’m worried about the randomizing additional feature. I believe it would be a cool aspect to dive into but not sure what the UI would look like, or how it will work. Most of the issues that I come across in projects happen when I have an idea that is UI-related. I hope my understanding of React and Redux is good enough to be able to accomplish this using a component-based framework.
